ATM machine program in C

Description: This project implements a basic ATM machine simulation using C programming language. The ATM program allows users to interact with an account, perform functions such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and changing PINs. It uses structures to represent the account and various control structures like if-else, loops, and functions to simulate the behavior of an ATM.

Features: Check Balance: Users can view the current balance in their account. Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their account. Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their account, given that the balance is sufficient. Change PIN: Users can change their ATM PIN for enhanced security. Multiple Account Support (Optional): The program can be expanded to handle multiple users.

Technologies Used: C Programming Language Structures: To define the ATM user and account details. Functions: To modularize operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking. Control Structures: If-else, loops, etc., to navigate and execute different ATM options.
